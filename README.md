# Reactive Java Workshop

Welcome to the Reactive Java Workshop! This repository is designed to help you understand, implement, and harness the power of reactive programming in Java.

## Purpose

Reactive programming is an essential paradigm in modern software development, particularly for building responsive and scalable applications. The purpose of this workshop is to:

- Introduce you to the principles of reactive programming.
- Provide hands-on experience with popular reactive libraries in Java, such as [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) 
- Guide you through practical examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding.
- Equip you with the skills to build reactive systems that can handle asynchronous and event-driven scenarios effectively.

## Benefits

By participating in this workshop and exploring the code and exercises in this repository, you will gain the following benefits:

- **Understanding of Reactive Programming**: Learn the core concepts of reactive programming, including Observables, Subscribers, Operators, and more.

- **Hands-on Experience**: Get practical experience by working on real-world examples and exercises that demonstrate how to apply reactive principles in Java.

- **Scalability**: Discover how reactive programming can help you build applications that scale efficiently, making the most of multi-core processors and handling high loads gracefully.

- **Responsive Applications**: Learn how to create applications that are responsive to user input, external events, and changing data sources.

- **Error Handling**: Explore techniques for handling errors and failures in a reactive way, ensuring robust and reliable applications.
